## Overview 

Audioprism is a decentralized application based on ICP and relying on Musicgen & Stable diffusion AI models. 
It allows anybody able to create an ICP wallet to mint generative NFTs (both sound & image), without any prior technical knowledge about AI or blockchain.
The process is straight forward: user is being asked questions, he/she answers just by clicking on images whose hidden attributes / keywords get combined to generate the NFT.
User provides his/her ICP address, and get sent the NFT as soon as it gets minted.
